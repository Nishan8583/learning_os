### Key Notes on Operating System Issues for Dynamic Relocation

1. **OS Responsibilities for Dynamic Relocation**:
    - The OS must manage memory, handle exceptions, and coordinate hardware during process creation, execution, termination, and context switching.

---

2. **Memory Management**:
    - **Process Creation**:
        - The OS allocates memory for a new process by searching a **free list** (a data structure tracking unused memory slots).
        - Assumes fixed-size address spaces for simplicity.
    - **Process Termination**:
        - The OS reclaims memory used by a terminated process and updates the free list.
        - Cleans up associated data structures (e.g., process control block or PCB).

3. **Base and Bounds Management**:
    - **Context Switching**:
        - The OS saves the **base and bounds register values** of the current process to its PCB.
        - Restores the base and bounds values for the next process to run.
    - **Relocating Address Spaces**:
        - The OS can move a process's address space in memory by:
            1. Descheduling the process.
            2. Copying its address space to a new location.
            3. Updating the base register in the PCB.
            4. Resuming the process with the updated base register.

4. **Exception Handling**:
    - **Exception Handlers**:
        - The OS installs handlers at boot time using privileged instructions.
        - Examples of exceptions:
            - **Out-of-Bounds Memory Access**: The OS terminates the offending process.
            - **Illegal Instructions**: The OS handles the violation and protects the system.
    - **Common OS Reaction**:
        - The OS is protective of the system and will terminate misbehaving processes to maintain stability.

5. **Boot-Time OS Initialization**:
    - At boot, the OS prepares the system for use:
        - **Trap Table Initialization**:
            - Sets up addresses for system call, timer, illegal memory access, and illegal instruction handlers.
        - **Timer Initialization**:
            - Starts a timer to trigger periodic interrupts for context switching.
        - **Memory Management Setup**:
            - Initializes the process table and free list.

---

6. **Limited Direct Execution**:
    - The OS sets up the hardware and lets processes run directly on the CPU.
    - **OS Involvement**:
        - The OS intervenes only during exceptions (e.g., illegal memory access) or timer interrupts (for context switching).
    - **Example Timeline**:
        - **Process A** starts running, and its memory translations are handled by hardware.
        - A **timer interrupt** occurs, and the OS switches to **Process B**.
        - **Process B** executes an illegal memory access, triggering an exception.
        - The OS terminates **Process B**, reclaims its memory, and removes its entry from the process table.

---

7. **Key Takeaways**:
    - The OS plays a critical role in managing memory, handling exceptions, and coordinating hardware for dynamic relocation.
    - By combining hardware support and OS management, a simple form of virtual memory is implemented.
    - The OS ensures system stability by terminating misbehaving processes and reclaiming resources efficiently.
