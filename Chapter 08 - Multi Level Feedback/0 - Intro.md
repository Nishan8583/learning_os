**Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) Scheduling**

- **Problem Statement**: Develop a scheduler that optimizes both turnaround time and response time without knowing job lengths in advance.

- **Goals**:

- Minimize turnaround time (run shorter jobs first)

- Minimize response time (make system feel responsive to interactive users)

- **Challenge**: Unknown job lengths make it difficult to achieve both goals simultaneously.

- **MLFQ Solution**: A scheduler that learns job characteristics as the system runs and makes better scheduling decisions.

**Key Questions**

- How can a scheduler minimize response time for interactive jobs?

- How can a scheduler minimize turnaround time without knowing job lengths?

- How can a scheduler learn job characteristics and adapt its decisions?
