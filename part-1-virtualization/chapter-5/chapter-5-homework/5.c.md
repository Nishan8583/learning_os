Now write a program that uses wait() to wait for the child process to finish in the parent. What does wait() return? What happens if you use wait() in the child?
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    int rc = fork();

    if (rc == -1) {
        perror("Fork failed");
        exit(1);
    } else if (rc == 0) {
        printf("In child\n");
        int c =  wait(NULL);
        printf("Parent has finished %d\n", c);
    } else {
        printf("Parent \n");
        int c = wait(&rc);
        printf("Child has finished %d\n", c);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
