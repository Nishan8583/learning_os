Write a program that calls fork(). Before calling fork(), have the main process access a variable (e.g., x) and set its value to something (e.g., 100). What value is the variable in the child process? What happens to the variable when both the child and parent change the value of x?
- Both have its own copy of variable 

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    int x = 100; // in my head, child should have its own copy of x

    int rc = fork();

    if (rc < 0) {
        perror("failed to fork(): ");
        exit(1);
    } else if (rc == 0) {
        // Child process
        printf("Child process (pid: %d) X is %d\n", (int)getpid(),x);
        x = 18;
        printf("Child process (pid: %d) X is %d\n", (int)getpid(),x);
    } else {
        // Parent process
        printf("Parent process (pid: %d) X is %d\n", (int)getpid(),x);
        x = 88;
        printf("Parent process (pid: %d) X is %d\n", (int)getpid(),x);
    }

    printf("Exiting (pid: %d) X is %d\n", (int)getpid(),x);

}```
