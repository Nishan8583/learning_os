Excellent question — this is one of those subtle points about how **virtual memory** works in Linux (and other modern OSes). Let’s break it down carefully.

---

### 🧩 The concept: process address space

Each process **has its own virtual address space** — a continuous range of addresses that the process _thinks_ it owns.

This space is divided into:

- **User portion** → used for user code, stack, heap, libraries, etc.
    
- **Kernel portion** → reserved for the kernel.
    

---

### 🧠 Is the kernel portion per-process?

**No**, it’s _not a separate kernel memory for each process_.

Here’s what actually happens:

| Concept            | Description                                                                                                                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User portion**   | Unique to each process. Different processes have completely different user portions.                                       |
| **Kernel portion** | The _same physical memory_ (the same kernel code and data) is mapped into the top part of _every process’s address space._ |

So although each process’s page tables have entries for the kernel portion, **those entries all point to the same physical kernel memory**.

In other words, each process’s virtual address space _includes_ the kernel, but that kernel region is **shared and identical** across all processes.

This setup allows the kernel to:

- Switch to kernel mode (e.g., on a system call or interrupt) **without changing the page tables**.
    
- Access kernel code and data directly using those virtual addresses.
    

---

### 🔒 Why is it done this way?

When a user process executes a system call or an interrupt occurs:

- The CPU switches from **user mode** → **kernel mode**.
    
- The kernel can then run in the same address space (no need to reload new mappings).
    
- User-space addresses are still accessible (for e.g., reading buffers passed by user).
    

This design is much faster and simpler than switching page tables to a separate kernel-only address space.

---

### 💾 “Not swapped to disk” — what that means

When the book says _the kernel portion is not swapped out to disk_, it means:

- **User-space memory pages** (heap, stack, etc.) _can_ be swapped out to disk when physical memory is full.
    
- **Kernel memory pages** (the kernel code, data structures, device buffers, etc.) _cannot_ be swapped out.
    

That’s because:

- The kernel must always be resident in memory to handle interrupts, I/O, and manage processes.
    
- Swapping out the kernel itself would be catastrophic — you’d have no code left to handle the page fault that tries to bring it back! 😅
    

So, kernel pages are _pinned_ in physical memory — they always stay there.

---

### 🧱 Visual Summary

Let’s imagine a 32-bit address space (4 GB total):
```
+---------------------------+  0xFFFFFFFF
|     Kernel space          |  (same in all processes)
|     (~1 GB)               |
+---------------------------+  0xC0000000
|     User space            |  (unique per process)
|     (~3 GB)               |
+---------------------------+  0x00000000

```


Each process’s view looks the same, but:

- The **lower 3 GB** is _different_ (per process),
    
- The **upper 1 GB** is _shared_ (the same kernel).
    

---

### ✅ In short

|Concept|Meaning|
|---|---|
|“Address space has user and kernel portion”|Every process’s virtual address space includes both regions.|
|“Is kernel portion per-process?”|No, it’s shared across all processes (same physical memory).|
|“Not swapped to disk”|Kernel memory stays permanently in RAM; only user-space memory can be swapped out.|


---



## 🧩 Two different things:

When we talk about “not swapped,” there are **two layers** involved:

1. **Virtual → physical mappings (page tables)**  
    These are the _entries_ that tell the CPU where a virtual address points in physical memory.
    
2. **Physical memory pages themselves**  
    These are the _actual chunks of RAM_ that hold kernel code, data, etc.
    

---

### 🧠 1. The mappings (page tables)

Each process’s page tables _include entries for kernel memory_ (so the kernel region is virtually mapped).  
These mappings:

- Exist in every process’s page tables.
    
- Are _identical_ across all processes.
    
- Always point to the same physical pages where the kernel lives.
    

👉 These mappings themselves are _not swapped out_.  
They’re part of the process’s page tables, and the OS ensures kernel mappings are always present and valid.

However:

- The **page tables for user space** can change, or user mappings can be swapped out.
    
- The **kernel portion of the page tables** is fixed — the OS won’t mark those pages as swappable.
    

---

### 💾 2. The physical kernel pages

The **physical memory** that the kernel occupies — i.e.:

- The kernel code (.text),
    
- Static data (.data, .bss),
    
- Important kernel structures,
    
- Core buffers (like the page cache, networking buffers, etc.) —
    

**is never swapped to disk**.  
Those physical pages stay in RAM permanently.

Why? Because:

- The kernel must always be present to handle interrupts, context switches, and I/O.
    
- Swapping out kernel memory would mean the swapper itself disappears! 😅
    

---

### 🧱 Putting it together

Let’s visualize the layers:
```
Virtual memory (per process)
────────────────────────────────────────────
0x00000000 ──────────────────────────────┐
| User space (unique per process)        |
| -> mappings can change and swap out    |
|                                        |
|                                        |
+----------------------------------------+  e.g., 0xC0000000
| Kernel space (shared across all procs) |
| -> mappings are identical              |
| -> point to kernel physical pages      |
| -> never swapped                       |
0xFFFFFFFF ──────────────────────────────┘

```

And beneath that:
```
Physical memory (RAM)
────────────────────────────────────────────
| Kernel code + data (pinned in RAM)  |
| Page tables (contain kernel mappings)|
| User pages (can be swapped)          |
────────────────────────────────────────────

```


### ✅ Summary Table

| Concept                       | Swappable?   | Shared?                       | Description                           |
| ----------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| User-space memory pages       | ✅ Yes        | ❌ No                          | Can be swapped to disk.               |
| Kernel memory pages           | ❌ No         | ✅ Yes                         | Always in physical RAM.               |
| Kernel portion of page tables | ❌ No         | ✅ Yes (identical per process) | Mappings always present and valid.    |
| User portion of page tables   | ✅ Indirectly | ❌ No                          | Can change when swapping user memory. |

So to directly answer your question:

> “So even the mapping to kernel physical memory not swapped? Or is only the physical kernel portion in memory not swapped?”

✅ Both —

- The **mappings** to kernel memory are _never swapped out or removed_.
    
- The **kernel’s physical pages** are _never swapped to disk_ either.
    

They’re both fixed and always resident.

---



## 🧠 Yes — the kernel mappings are **identical across all processes**

Every process in Linux has its own **page table**, which defines how its virtual addresses map to physical memory.  
But for the **kernel portion** of the virtual address space, the mappings are:

- **The same in every process’s page table**
    
- **Pointing to the same physical memory (the actual kernel code, data, etc.)**
    
- **Always present and identical in content**
    

So while the **user portion** differs per process, the **kernel portion** is shared and mapped identically.

---

### 📘 Example: 32-bit address space layout (common textbook view)

Assume a 4 GB virtual address space per process:

| Virtual Address Range     | Purpose      | Shared? | Swappable? |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | ------- | ---------- |
| `0x00000000 – 0xBFFFFFFF` | User space   | ❌ No    | ✅ Yes      |
| `0xC0000000 – 0xFFFFFFFF` | Kernel space | ✅ Yes   | ❌ No       |


Each process sees this same layout — but:

- The **lower 3 GB** (user space) maps to _different_ physical memory per process.
    
- The **upper 1 GB** (kernel space) maps to _the same_ physical memory for everyone.
    

So, if you dumped the page tables of two processes, you’d see:

- Different mappings below `0xC0000000`
    
- Identical mappings from `0xC0000000` upward.
    

---

### 🧩 Why this design?

This design has a huge advantage:

- When a **context switch** happens (CPU switches from Process A → Process B),  
    the OS loads B’s page table.
    
- But the **kernel half of both A and B’s page tables are identical**,  
    so the kernel memory doesn’t need to be remapped or flushed from the TLB.
    

That means:

- Faster context switches,
    
- Simpler handling of system calls and interrupts,
    
- Kernel code always accessible when running in kernel mode (for any process).
    

---

### ⚙️ In modern systems (64-bit note)

In 64-bit Linux, it’s conceptually the same, but the layout is larger:

| Example Virtual Range                     | Description                                |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `0x0000000000000000 – 0x00007FFFFFFFFFFF` | User space (per-process unique)            |
| `0xFFFF800000000000 – 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF` | Kernel space (shared across all processes) |

Still — **same idea**: identical kernel mappings across all processes.

---

### ✅ Summary

| Concept                 | User Portion | Kernel Portion |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| Mappings per process    | Different    | Identical      |
| Physical memory         | Different    | Same           |
| Swappable               | Yes          | No             |
| Shared across processes | No           | Yes            |

So yes — the **kernel mappings are identical** in every process’s address space.  
That’s what allows the kernel to stay permanently resident and immediately accessible, no matter which process is running.
