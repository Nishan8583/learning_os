### Key Notes on FIFO Scheduling

#### **Definition and Basics**

- **FIFO (First In, First Out)**, also known as **First Come, First Served (FCFS)**, is the simplest scheduling algorithm.
- Jobs are processed in the order they arrive, with no preemption.
- Easy to implement and works well under certain assumptions.

#### **Example of FIFO with Equal Job Lengths**

- **Scenario**: Three jobs (A, B, and C) arrive at the same time, each running for 10 seconds.
- **Turnaround Times**:
    - A finishes at 10 seconds.
    - B finishes at 20 seconds.
    - C finishes at 30 seconds.
- **Average Turnaround Time**:  
    [(10 + 20 + 30) / 3 = 20]

#### **Limitations of FIFO**

1. **Performance Issues with Jobs of Different Lengths**:
    
    - **Scenario**: Job A runs for 100 seconds, while jobs B and C run for 10 seconds each.
    - **Turnaround Times**:
        - A finishes at 100 seconds.
        - B finishes at 110 seconds.
        - C finishes at 120 seconds.
    - **Average Turnaround Time**:  
        [(100 + 110 + 120) / 3 = 110]
    - **Problem**: Shorter jobs (B and C) are delayed by the longer job (A), leading to poor performance.
2. **Convoy Effect**:
    
    - Short jobs are forced to wait behind a long job, causing inefficiency.
    - Analogy: Similar to waiting in a grocery store line behind someone with a full cart while you only have a few items.

#### **Improvement Suggestions**

- **Shortest Job First (SJF)**:
    - Prioritize shorter jobs to reduce average turnaround time.
    - Commonly used in real-world scenarios like "10-items-or-less" lines at grocery stores to improve customer satisfaction.

#### **Key Takeaways**

- FIFO is simple but can perform poorly when job lengths vary significantly.
- The **convoy effect** is a major drawback, where short jobs are delayed by long ones.
- **SJF** is a better alternative for systems where turnaround time and customer satisfaction are critical.
