### Key Notes: Limited Direct Execution (LDE)

#### **Mechanism of CPU Virtualization**

- **Objective**: Share the physical CPU among multiple jobs to create the illusion of simultaneous execution.
- **Method**: Time-sharing the CPU by running one process for a short duration, then switching to another.

#### **Challenges in CPU Virtualization**

1. **Performance**:
    - Virtualization must be implemented without introducing excessive overhead.
    - Efficient execution is critical to maintain system responsiveness.
2. **Control**:
    - The OS must retain control over the CPU to:
        - Prevent processes from running indefinitely or monopolizing the CPU.
        - Ensure processes cannot access unauthorized information.
    - Control is essential for resource management and system security.

#### **Central Challenge**

- **Crux**: Efficiently virtualize the CPU while maintaining control.
- **Solution**:
    - Combine **hardware support** and **operating system mechanisms** to achieve efficient virtualization.
    - The OS leverages hardware features to manage processes effectively and enforce control.

#### **Key Takeaway**

- The balance between **performance** and **control** is crucial in building an operating system that virtualizes the CPU effectively.

### Key Notes: Limited Direct Execution (LDE)

#### **Definition**

- **Limited Direct Execution (LDE)**: A technique where the operating system (OS) runs a program directly on the CPU to maximize performance while maintaining control.

#### **Direct Execution Process**

1. **Steps to Start a Program**:
    
    - Create an entry for the process in the process list.
    - Allocate memory for the program.
    - Load the program code into memory (from disk).
    - Locate the program's entry point (e.g., `main()` routine).
    - Set up the stack with arguments (`argc/argv`).
    - Clear CPU registers.
    - Jump to the program's `main()` and start execution.
2. **Steps to End a Program**:
    
    - Execute the return from `main()`.
    - Free the memory allocated to the process.
    - Remove the process entry from the process list.

#### **Challenges in Direct Execution**

1. **Control**:
    
    - How does the OS ensure the program doesn’t perform unauthorized actions while running directly on the CPU?
    - Without limits, the OS would lose control, reducing it to a mere library.
2. **Time Sharing**:
    
    - How does the OS stop a running process and switch to another to implement time-sharing for CPU virtualization?

#### **Key Insights**

- **Efficiency**: Direct execution ensures programs run as fast as possible by leveraging the CPU directly.
- **Control Mechanisms**: The "limited" aspect of LDE arises from the need to impose restrictions on programs to maintain OS control.
- **Virtualization Goal**: The OS must balance performance and control to virtualize the CPU effectively.

#### **Takeaway**

- Without limits, the OS cannot enforce control, making it ineffective as a resource manager. LDE combines **direct execution** for performance with **limits** for control, enabling efficient CPU virtualization.
